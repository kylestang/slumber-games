# Slumber Games

A cloudflare workers based website that lets you compete against your friends to
see who can get the most sleep! *Slumber Games* plugs in to Garmin's connect API
to automatically download the sleep data of all competitors. Yes, that does
mean it needs full access to your Garmin account to work. Just don't mention
that part to your friends.

May the odds be ever in your favour.
